## Advanced Prompt Techniques

### Style Mixing
Combine different art styles to create unique aesthetics:

```
[Your normal prompt], [composition type] composition, [focal point details], [perspective]
```

Example:
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Inconsistent Character Designs
**Solution**: Create a character reference sheet first, then use "in the style of reference image" or "character looks exactly like [description of your reference]" in your prompts.

### Problem: Text on Cards is Illegible or Distorted
**Solution**: Generate the art without text, then add text separately in a design program. Alternatively, use Ideogram specifically for text elements with prompts like "clear, legible text saying '[your text]'" prominently displayed.

### Problem: Inconsistent Art Style Between Cards
**Solution**: Always use the same base style descriptors and create a "style anchor" image that you reference in all future prompts.

### Problem: Anatomical Issues or Distortions
**Solution**: Add "anatomically correct", "proper proportions", and "realistic anatomy" to your prompts. For persistent issues, generate at a wider zoom/composition and crop in post-processing.

## Expanding Your Game

### Creating New Factions
1. Define the faction's visual identity (colors, shapes, technology style)
2. Create 3-5 "anchor" images that establish the look
3. Document specific keywords that trigger the style
4. Test consistency across character types before full production

### Maintaining Style Across Expansions
1. Keep a visual library of all previous cards
2. Reference specific successful prompts when creating new, similar cards
3. Periodically review the entire collection for style drift
4. Update your style guide with new elements as they're established
