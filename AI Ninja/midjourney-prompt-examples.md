## Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Maintain Consistency**: Use the same `--stylize 750` value and `--ar 2:3` (for cards) or `--ar 1:1` (for tokens) across all generations to keep a consistent style.

2. **Save Successful Seeds**: When you get a result you particularly like, note the seed number and use it for similar cards with the `--seed [number]` parameter.

3. **Iterate Gradually**: If a result is close but not perfect, use the U1-U4 buttons to upscale the best version, then V1-V4 to create variations of that specific image.

4. **Batch Similar Cards**: Generate all cards of the same faction in one session to maintain consistent faction aesthetics.

5. **Style Reference**: If you create a card that perfectly captures your desired style, use it as a reference for future generations with `--sref [URL]` (if you have a Pro subscription).

6. **Post-Processing**: Remember that these raw generations will need to be enhanced and have card frames/text added in post-processing.
