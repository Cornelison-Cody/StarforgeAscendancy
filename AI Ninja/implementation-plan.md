   ```
   /imagine prompt: stylized illustration showing the art style for a cyberpunk sci-fi trading card game with sleek futuristic technology and vibrant colors, showing examples of characters, ships, and technology from different factions, clean sophisticated design, highly detailed, professional trading card game art --ar 3:2 --stylize 750
   ```
   - Generate 3-4 variations until you find one that matches your vision
   - Upscale your favorite result and save it as your primary style reference

3. **Create Faction Style Guides**
   - Generate one representative image for each faction using these prompts:
   ```
   /imagine prompt: stylized illustration showing the visual style guide for [Faction Name] in a cyberpunk sci-fi trading card game, displaying character, ship, technology, and environment examples all using the faction's [color scheme] palette, sleek futuristic cyberpunk, clean sophisticated technology, highly detailed, professional trading card game art --ar 3:2 --stylize 750
   ```
   - Create one for each of your six factions
   - Save these as your faction style references

### Day 2: Card Frame Design and Organization Setup

1. **Design Basic Card Frames**

## Ongoing Process: Expansion and Refinement

### For Future Expansions

1. **Document Successful Prompts**
   - Keep a record of which prompts produced the best results
   - Note any specific parameters or seed values that worked well

2. **Refine Style Guide**
   - Update the style guide based on what worked best
   - Add examples of successful cards as references

3. **Develop Batch Generation Process**
   - Create templates for efficiently generating new card sets
   - Establish a consistent workflow for new content

### Efficiency Tips

1. **Use Consistent Parameters**
   - Always use the same `--stylize` value (750 recommended)
   - Use consistent aspect ratios (2:3 for cards, 1:1 for tokens)
   - When you find a good seed value, use it for similar cards

2. **Batch Similar Items**
   - Generate all cards of the same type or faction in one session
   - This helps maintain visual consistency

3. **Save Time with Templates**
   - Create action scripts or templates in your design software
   - Automate repetitive aspects of card assembly

4. **Track Everything**
   - Keep your asset tracking spreadsheet updated
   - Document which prompts and parameters worked best
   - Note any issues or challenges for future reference
